# Some-Things-Math

## Purpose
A repository to practice on GitHub and provide education resources as well.

I'm a bit new to using GitHub, so I'm creating this repository as practice for using this platform and practicing with certain css techniques.  Some documents I've already created on my local machine, but I will attempt to practice with various processes (commit, branching, etc) that the platform offers rather than just creating everything on my machine.

And this is called Some-Things-Math because I definitely will not be tackling All-Things-Math.
